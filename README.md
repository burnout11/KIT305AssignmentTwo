#### Application requirements:
1) A main screen providing the name of your application and buttons that link to the other functionality of your application. Background images, motivational support, and current progress in fulfilling the dietary guidelines are some additional features that you may consider incorporating. 

2) A screen that allows a user to record his or her daily food servings from each of the five food groups. This should include the type of food, the food group to which it belongs, and the quantity (as measured in servings). Depending on your application design, this data may be entered by the user at the end of the day, or throughout the day as part of a running total. Additional functionality may focus on providing the user with information on what a serving size is for each of the food groups, or intuitively incorporating serving sizes into the manner in which quantities are recorded by the user. Additional functionality may also be to record foods that are not part of the five food groups (i.e. discretionary choices like sweets) as outlined on page 27 (NHMRC, 2013).

3) A screen that allows a user to view his or her past historical data on food patterns. This screen should also indicate to the user how his/her diet compares to the suggested recommended serving guidelines for each food group. Depending on your choice of design, this summary might show a running summary (e.g. for the last 7 days) or a summary based on the past calendar week, or month.

4) A screen that provides feedback on how the user can improve his or her diet. This screen might be personalised to the user or just provide generic suggestions. Similarly, the feedback might be presented to the user at a contextually relevant time in the use of the application, or simply as a screen that allows the user to find out more information.

#### Application features:
1) Usability i.e. learnable, memorable, efficient, failure-resistant, forgiving and satisfying.

2) Particular emphasis will be placed on the "forgiving" aspect of usability, which means that the application should allow a user to correct accidental and incorrect entries.
